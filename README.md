# Invisibility Cloak Project

## Overview
This project is a fun application of computer vision that creates an "invisibility cloak" effect using a simple webcam. By using specific colors as the cloak, the program replaces these colors with the background, rendering the object (or person) covered by the color invisible.

## Features
- **Color Detection**: Detects specific colors to create the invisibility effect. Currently supports red, blue, and green.
- **Dynamic Background**: Captures the background at the start for a seamless replacement.
- **Real-time Video Processing**: Processes the video feed in real-time to apply the invisibility effect.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- NumPy library
